The main difference is that instead of specifying a range of values for each hyperparameter in the param_dist dictionary, we specify a set of specific values to try in the param_grid dictionary. The GridSearchCV object is set up with a RandomForestRegressor object, and the hyperparameters to be tuned are max_depth, max_features, min_samples_leaf, and criterion. The GridSearchCV object will evaluate all possible combinations of the specified parameter values and will return the best set of hyperparameters. The cv parameter controls the number of folds used in cross-validation, and the iid parameter controls whether the data is assumed to be independently and identically distributed.\n",
